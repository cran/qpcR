\title{Calculation of Akaike weights/relative likelihoods/delta-AICs}

\description{
Calculates Akaike weights from a vector of AIC values. 
}

\usage{
akaike.weights(x)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector containing the AIC values.}
}

\details{
Although Akaike's Information Criterion is recognized as a major measure for selecting models, it has one major drawback: The AIC values lack intuitivity despite higher values meaning less goodness-of-fit. For this purpose, Akaike weights come to hand for calculating the weights in a regime of several models. Additional measures can be derived, such as \eqn{\Delta(AIC)} and relative likelihoods that demonstrate the probability of one model being in favor over the other. This is done by using the following formulas:

delta AICs: \deqn{\Delta_i(AIC) = AIC_i - min(AIC)}

relative likelihood: \deqn{L \propto exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\Delta_i(AIC)\right)}

Akaike weights: \deqn{w_i(AIC) = \frac{exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\Delta_i(AIC)\right)}{\sum_{k=1}^K exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\Delta_k(AIC)\right)}}
}

\value{
A list containing the following items:
\item{deltaAIC}{the \eqn{\Delta(AIC)} values.}
\item{rel.LL}{the relative likelihoods.}
\item{weights}{the Akaike weights.}
