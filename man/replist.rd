\title{Amalgamation of single data models into a model containing replicates}

\description{
Starting from a 'modlist' containing qPCR models from single data, \code{replist} amalgamates the models according to the grouping structure as defined in \code{group}. The result is a 'replist' with models obtained from fitting the replicates by \code{\link{pcrfit}}. A kinetic outlier detection and removal option is included.
}

\usage{
replist(object, group = NULL, check = "none",
        checkPAR = parKOD(), remove = c("none", "KOD"), 
        names = c("group", "first"), doFit = TRUE, opt = FALSE, 
        optPAR = list(sig.level = 0.05, crit = "ftest"), 
        verbose = TRUE, ...)
}

\arguments{
 \item{object}{an object of class 'modlist'.}
 \item{group}{a vector defining the replicates for each group.}
 \item{check}{which method to use for kinetic outlier detection. Either \code{none} or any of the methods in \code{\link{KOD}}.}
 \item{checkPAR}{parameters to be supplied to the \code{check} method, see \code{\link{KOD}}.}
 \item{remove}{which runs to remove. Either \code{none} or those that failed from the method defined in \code{check}.}
 \item{names}{how to name the grouped fit. Either 'group_1, ...' or the first name of the replicates.}
 \item{doFit}{logical. If set to \code{FALSE}, the replicate data is only aggregated without doing a refitting. See 'Details'.}
 \item{opt}{logical. Should model selection be applied to the final model?}
 \item{optPAR}{parameters to be supplied to \code{\link{mselect}}.}
 \item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE}, the analysis is printed to the console.}
 \item{...}{other parameters to be supplied to \code{\link{mselect}}.}    
}

\details{
As being defined by \code{group}, the 'modlist' is split into groups of runs and these amalgamated into a nonlinear model. Runs which have failed to be fitted by \code{\link{modlist}} are automatically removed and \code{group} is updated (that is, the correpsonding entries also removed) prior to fitting the replicate model by \code{\link{pcrfit}}. Model selection can be applied to the final replicate model by setting \code{opt = TRUE} and changing the parameters in \code{optPAR}. If \code{check} is set to any of the methods in \code{"KOD"}, kinetic outliers are identified and optionally removed, if \code{remove} is set to \code{"KOD"}.\cr
If \code{doFit = FALSE}, the replicate data is only aggregated and no refitting is done. This is useful when plotting replicate data by some grouping vector. See 'Examples'.
