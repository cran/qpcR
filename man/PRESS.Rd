\title{Allen's PRESS (Prediction Sum-Of-Squares) statistic, aka P-square}

\description{
 Calculates the PRESS statistic, a leave-one-out refitting and prediction method, as described in Allen (1971).
 Works for any regression model with a \code{call} slot, an \code{\link{update}} and a \code{\link{predict}} function, hence all models of class \code{lm}, \code{glm}, \code{nls} and \code{drc} (and maybe more...).
 The function also returns the PRESS analog to R-square, the P-square.

\usage{
PRESS(object, verbose = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{object}{a fitted model.}
  \item{verbose}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, iterations are displayed on the console.} 
}

\details{
From a fitted model, each of the predictors \eqn{x_i, i = 1 \ldots{n}} is removed and the model is refitted to the \eqn{n-1} points.
The predicted value \eqn{\hat{y}_{i, -i}} is calculated at the excluded point \eqn{x_i} and the PRESS statistic is given by:
\deqn{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_{i, -i})^2}
The PRESS statistic is a surrogate measure of crossvalidation of small sample sizes and a measure for internal validity.
Small values indicate that the model is not overly sensitive to any single data point.
The P-square value, the PRESS equivalent to R-square, is given by \deqn{P^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{\varepsilon}^2_{-i}}{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
 with \eqn{\hat\varepsilon_{-i} = y_i - \hat{y}_{-i}}.

\value{
A list with the following components:
  \item{stat}{The PRESS statistic.}
  \item{residuals}{a vector containing the PRESS residuals for each \eqn{x_i}.}  
  \item{P.square}{the P-square value. See 'Details'.}

\note{
There is also a \code{PRESS} function in library 'MPV' that works solely for \code{lm} models using the hat matrix.
